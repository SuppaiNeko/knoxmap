"""A map file is written whole, or the one from before is still there.

A generate writes a dozen files into the map folder - the ground, the
buildings, the land use, the fences - and each used to be written straight to
its own name. Stop the generate, close the window or lose the machine halfway
through one and what stayed was half a file, which the next Build read as the
map and died on:

    Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 32790 (char 32789)

What is worth checking is that an interrupted write leaves the file that was
there before, that a half-written one is reported as damaged rather than
silently read as an empty map, and that a file which is simply not there is
still "nothing of that kind here".
