"""The map's own files, written whole and read with a straight answer.

A map folder holds the ground as bitmaps and a dozen small JSON files beside
them - its buildings, its land use, its fences, what it is and how big. Each
was written straight to its own name, so a generate that was stopped, crashed
or had the window closed on it left one of them half written, and the next
Build died on the half:

    Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 32790 (char 32789)

Nobody can act on that. Each file is now written beside itself and moved into
place, which is one step on every system this runs on: what is on disk is
either the file from before or the new one, never half of either. And reading
one says which file it is, what it holds and what to do about it.
